        <div class="steps">
          <h4>Step 1:</h4>
          <p>
            To begin making the Butter Naan recipe, in a large bowl add the 3
            cups of flour and butter. With your hands, blend the butter into the
            flour until it forms coarse crumbs. You can do this in a blender as
            well, but the dough when worked with hands gives a better texture to
            the dough.
          </p>
          <h4>Step 2:</h4>
          <p>
            Stir together the warm water, yeast and sugar until yeast is
            completely dissolved. Now make a well in the center of the flour
            mixture and add the yogurt, salt and yeast mixture.
          </p>
          <h4>Step 3:</h4>
          <p>
            Knead into the flour and until the whole dough collects into a mass.
            Add a little more water if required to bring the dough together. The
            dough will be wet and sticky.
          </p>
          <h4>Step 4:</h4>
          <p>
            Wipe your hands clean and oil them. Now knead the naan dough with
            the oiled hands until smooth , for about 10 minutes; oil your hands
            more if the dough is sticky. The dough after 10 minutes of kneading
            will still be soft and pliable.
          </p>
          <h4>Step 5:</h4>
          <p>
            Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl and allow the
            dough to rest for 3 to 4 hours until the dough has doubled in
            volume.
          </p>
          <h4>Step 6:</h4>
          <p>
            Once the naan dough has doubled, punch down the dough, knead for a
            minute and divide into 12 to 15 equal portions.
          </p>
          <h4>Step 7:</h4>
          <p>
            With a rolling pin, quickly roll out each ball into a 5 inch oval.
            With your fingers, stretch each round into a 5-7 inch oval. The next
            step is to cook the naans. Follow either of the below methods.
          </p>
          <h4>Step 8:</h4>
          <p>
            Heat an iron skillet on high heat. Place the rolled naans out on the
            skillet and cook on both sides until you can see light brown spots
            and bubbles coming through. Using tongs, flip the naan directly on
            the flame to give it the roasted flavor and make it little more
            crisp.
          </p>
          <h4>Step 9:</h4>
          <p>Once done, remove from the flame and serve hot.</p>
          <h4>Step 10:</h4>
          <p>
            Brush the tops of the Butter Naan lightly with chaat masala and
            butter if desired. Serve the Butter Naans hot.
          </p>
          <h4>Step 11:</h4>
          <p>
            Serve Homemade Butter Naan recipe with Paneer Makhani or Smoked Dal
            Makhani Dhaba Style Recipe and Pickled Onions for a weekend lunch or
            dinner.
