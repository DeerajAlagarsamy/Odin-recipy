        <h4>Step 1:</h4>
        <p>
          To begin making the Homemade Idli Dosa Batter, soak the rice in water,
          such that the all the rice is completely immersed in water. Let it
          soak for about 6 hours.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2:</h4>
        <p>
          Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is
          completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3:</h4>
        <p>
          First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add
          just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The
          batter will look fluffy. Pour this batter into a large container.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4:</h4>
        <p>
          Grind the rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of
          water to grind into a almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will
          make the dosa batter too watery. If required grind a little at a time
          to get a almost smooth batter .
        </p>
        <h4>Step 5:</h4>
        <p>
          Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for
          at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will
          notice the batter would have risen in volume.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 6:</h4>
        <p>
          Heat the skillet on medium heat and pour a ladleful of dosa batter
          over the skillet and spread the batter evenly using a spiral motion
          from inside out.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 7:</h4>
        <p>
          Pour a teaspoon of ghee around the edges and increase the heat and
          cook the ghee roast dosa for couple of minutes until the bottom of the
          dosa starts to turn golden brown.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 8:</h4>
        <p>
          Turn the ghee roast dosa over carefully and cook the other side for a
          few seconds.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 9:</h4>
        <p>
          Turn over again and then fold them into half or roll them into a
          cylinder. Once done, serve the ghee roast dosa hot.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 10:</h4>
        <p>
          Serve the Ghee Roast Dosa Recipe/ Paper Dosa along with Thakkali
          Vengaya Sambar, Tomato Onion Chutney and Coconut Chutney, it tastes
          absolutely delectable.
